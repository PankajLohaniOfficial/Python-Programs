CODE:-
def compound_interest(principle, rate, time):
    Amount = principle * (pow((1 + rate / 100), time))
    CI = Amount - principle
    print("Compound interest is", CI)

principle = int ( input ( "Enter the principl ammount :- " ))
rate = int ( input ( "Enter the Rate of Interest :- " ))
time = int ( input ( "Enter the Time ( in years ) :- " ))
             
compound_interest(principle , rate , time)



OUTPUT:-
Enter the principl ammount :- 10000
Enter the Rate of Interest :- 10.25
Enter the Time ( in years ) :- 5
Compound interest is 6288.946267774416
