Code :-

principal = eval ( input ( "Enter the Principal Value :-" ))
rate = eval ( input ( "Enter the annual rate of interest :-" ))
time = int ( input ( "Enter the Time in Years :-" ))
simple_int = ( principal*rate*time ) / 100
ammount = principal+simple_int
print( "Simple Interest = " , simple_int)
print( "Ammount Payable = " , ammount )




Output :-

Enter the Principal Value :-8000
Enter the annual rate of interest :-15
Enter the Time in Years :-5
Simple Interest =  6000.0
Ammount Payable =  14000.0
